# Intro

The VAI-Lab framework uses a modular, plugin-based architecture.

Each module represents a process (e.g. Modelling) and each plugin is a specific implementation of that process (e.g. linear regression).

Modules can be chained, looped and modified in real-time to create a highly customisable framework for the user's requirements.
