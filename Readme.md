# AI assisted design

This framework aims to provide the means to easily build a fully operational Bayesian machine learning pipeline for different domains. 
This allows to adapt the machine learning algotithms to the task requirements and provide the output that best adapts to the problem needs.
Furthermore, its modular nature provides a way to intuitively combine certain modules for specific problems.

## UFA

The User Feedback Adaptation module provides the means to easily interact with the machine learning model to provide some feedback.
